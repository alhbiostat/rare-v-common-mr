# rare-v-common-mr

Comparing the performance of rare and common genetic instruments in an MR framework.

## Background

Rare variant associations with molecular and complex traits are now testable in large-scale population cohorts of whole-exome or whole-genome sequenced individuals. These varaiants typically have differing functional properties to common variants, having been suppressed to low population frequency by negative selective pressures acting against deleterious biological effects. In the context of mendelian randomisation (MR), it may be expected that genetic variants that have larger effect sizes, and tangibly interfere with molecular pathways, have greater utility in instrumenting molecular exposures. These vartiants may, for example, provide more accurate estimates of the causal effect of extreme modulation of a molecular exposure on a outcome (as in therapeutic inhibiton of a drug target).

This projects serves to investigate and compare the performance of rare genetic instruments for molecular traits with their common counterparts. Focusing initially on cis-acting protein quantitiative trait loci (pQTLs).
